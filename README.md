Hopefully it won't be to hard as I hope i have mastered most of the lessons I just spent the last day working on!

Wasn't that hard, getting the hang of using git cmd was harder than html
recfg git with proper name and linking it back was hard than whole html kind of, even if it wasnt really hard. html seemed kind of easy?
